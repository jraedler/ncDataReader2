Test the library:

- GenerateFile produces a small netCDF file (needed for most tests).

- GenerateBigFile produces a big netCDF file (needed for Read1DChunk).

- PrintVersion prints out the version and tests the error handler

- Read1D interpolates the 1D data in the small file with different interpolation
  and extrapolation types

- Read1DEasyAPI interpolates the 1D data in the small file using the easy API

- Read2D interpolates the 2D data in the small file 

- Read2DEasyAPI interpolates the 2D data in the small file using the easy API

- CacheTests tests performance with different cache sizes with the small file

- Read1DChunk interpolates some data in the big file using chunk loading

The results may be viewed with gnuplot.


GenerateFile.py is a python script that writes the same file as GenerateFile. 
You need scipy or pupynere installed (available at http://pypi.python.org/).


GenerateFile.m is an Octave port of this script. You need octcdf installed (look
at http://octave.sourceforge.net/octcdf/).
