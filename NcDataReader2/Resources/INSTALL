This package uses CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) to configure the sources and 
generate the needed files.

Linux
=====
Configuration and compilation
-----------------------------
Install CMake using the package manager of your distribution or download and 
install the program yourself. In this folder start one of:
    $ cmake .
or
    $ ccmake .
or
    $ cmake-gui .
    
Configure the sources as indicated by the program and generate the Makefiles. 
You may need to install additional packages. Then type:
    $ make

Installation
------------
Type
    $ make install

If you did not change the destination folders in CMake, this will install the
required files to /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include .

For most cases it may be sufficient to install the precompiled files.
